This document outlines the architecture of the Autonomous AI Video Creation Platform. The platform is designed to be a scalable, microservices-based application that leverages AI to automate the creation and distribution of social media videos.




## 1. High-Level Architecture

The platform follows a microservices-oriented architecture, with a React-based frontend, a Node.js backend, and a set of AI modules that handle specific tasks. The system is designed for scalability and fault tolerance, using a message queue for asynchronous job processing and cloud storage for media assets.

### 1.1 Frontend

*   **Framework:** React.js with TypeScript
*   **Styling:** TailwindCSS
*   **State Management:** Redux Toolkit
*   **Key Components:**
    *   Dashboard
    *   Project Creator/Editor
    *   Series Manager
    *   Social Media Calendar
    *   Settings Panel

### 1.2 Backend

*   **Framework:** Node.js with NestJS
*   **Database:**
    *   PostgreSQL: For structured data like users, settings, and series.
    *   MongoDB: For unstructured data like video metadata, scripts, and analytics.
*   **Job Queue:** Redis with BullMQ for managing asynchronous tasks like video rendering and AI processing.
*   **Storage:** AWS S3 for storing all media assets, including images, videos, and audio.

### 1.3 AI Modules

The AI modules are a collection of services that perform specific AI-related tasks. These can be a mix of third-party APIs and custom-built models.

*   **Topic Discovery:** Uses OpenAI's GPT-4 to research and identify trending topics.
*   **Hashtag Analysis:** A custom NLP model combined with social media APIs to find optimal hashtags.
*   **Voice Narration:** Integrates with ElevenLabs or Amazon Polly for text-to-speech.
*   **Image Generation:** Uses DALL-E 3 or Stability AI to create images from text prompts.
*   **Video Rendering:** Leverages `ffmpeg` for video processing and composition.
